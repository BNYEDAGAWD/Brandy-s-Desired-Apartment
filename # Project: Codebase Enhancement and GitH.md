Modern Web Scraping Frameworks
For anti-bot detection bypass and JavaScript-heavy sites, consider repositories that implement:

Puppeteer/Playwright Integration
Browser Automation: Headless browser control for JavaScript-rendered content
Anti-Detection: Stealth mode configurations to bypass bot detection
CAPTCHA Handling: Integration with CAPTCHA solving services
Proxy Rotation: Built-in proxy management for rate limiting avoidance
Key Features to Look For:
Rate Limiting: Intelligent request throttling
Session Management: Cookie and session persistence
Error Handling: Robust retry mechanisms
Data Validation: Real-time data quality checks
Recommended Implementation Stack
Technology Combination:
Frontend: JavaScript/Node.js with Puppeteer or Playwright
Backend: Express.js with MongoDB/PostgreSQL
Deployment: GitHub Pages with GitHub Actions
Notifications: Webhook integration for real-time alerts
Architecture Patterns:
Serverless Functions: AWS Lambda or Vercel for scalable scraping
Microservices: Separate services for different rental platforms
Event-Driven: Real-time processing with message queues
Progressive Web App: Mobile-responsive search interfaces
Legal & Compliance Considerations
When implementing these scrapers, ensure:

Respectful Rate Limiting: Honor robots.txt and implement delays
Terms of Service Compliance: Review platform policies
Data Privacy: Implement user data protection
Ethical Scraping: Use data responsibly and transparently
Deployment Strategy for GitHub Pages
For your September 2024 move-in timeline:

Static Site Generation: Use frameworks like Next.js or Gatsby
Client-Side Processing: Implement search logic in the browser
API Integration: Connect to serverless scraping functions
Real-Time Updates: Use WebSockets or Server-Sent Events
Mobile Optimization: Responsive design for apartment hunting on-the-go
West Los Angeles Specific Implementation
Focus on:

ZIP Code Targeting: 90025, 90064, 90024, 90034, 90035
Luxury Filters: Price range, amenities, square footage]
